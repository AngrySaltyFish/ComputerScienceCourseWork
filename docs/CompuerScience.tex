\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}
\subsection{Background}\label{background}
The main goal of this software to satisfy the client and their needs so
to do this successfully I need explain the situation my client
is in.

My client is a primary school teacher who would like to
use certain music during performances by the students. She genrally teaches
students of the age of 4 to 5. An example of a
song that would be needed by my client would a nursery rhyme like ``if
your happy and you know in clap your hands''. The current system in
place is virtually non existent by getting songs from online
and from CDs. This is usually means
going to websites that offer free versions of the songs and downloading
mp3 files from them. This is a poor solution to the problem as these website
are generally not trust worthy. Another solution that my client
currently uses is using spotify, the music streaming service. This still
is not a perfect system as many nursary rymes or less well known songs do
exist on it. The final method is by purchsing cds containing the songs
and then playing them. This is not perfect either as it becomes expensive
and usually only get a couple of the desired songs.
It should be noted that the current method of playing this music
is through a CD player and that this application needs to be able to
burn the new music onto a CD so it can still be played through the CD
player.
Since the user is going to have little technical knowledge the program
needs to be easy to use which means I will need to have a GUI interface
instead of a CLI one. So far there is only demand by a single client but
I also need to consider what the program is downloading as it should be
copyright-free material that will not have any legal problems surrounding
it. The client expressed deep concern over this matter.

\subsection{Hardware and Software limitaions}\label{SoftwareAndHardware}
This application will either be running on a personal computer or a school computer.
Since there is a possibility that it will be running as part of a network on a school
computer I need to consider certain restrictions that will be put upon the program.
One obvious limitation would be that the user is unlikely to have admin permissions
so I need to ensure that a normal user can run this program. The operating systems
that the school currently uses is Windows but I would like to keep it as cross-platform
as possible as people may run different OSs at home and the school may transition to
a different operating system in the future.

Now that I have outlined the enviroment that the application will run on I need to choose
the appropiate language and libraries to build it with. I have only used the following
languages in the past: javascript, python and c++. Javascript is gennerally only used
for web applications which means it has a lot of support for web scraping which will
be useful for finding and downloading music. Unfortunatly javascript can be slow
compared to other programming languages and genrally not used for desktop applications.
Python, similarly to javascript has a lot of support for networking but is not as fast
as c++ and python needs to be installed on the target computer before hand. Finally
we have c++. It is fast compared to python and javascript and since it is compiled
it does not need any additional programs to be installed beforehand. For this project
I will choose c++. This is because the computer it will run on is old slow meaning I
cannot take liberties when it comes to performance and since it is a work computer
having programs installed beforehand is not an option. This does come with some
design difficulties, the networking is going to be complex and to ensure that
the app is cross-platform it may need to be cross-compiled.

Now that I have chosen the language I wish to use I need now carefully pick
the libraries to use with it. This was an easy choice for as the api I am
most familiar with in c++ is Qt. This framework provides everything I need
to use for this project as it allows you to build GUIs and has support for networking.
It also states an emphasis on cross-platform meaning it aligns with all of my
objectives.

The client does already have a cd reader and writer built into the laptop meaning the only
additional hardware that is required is the actual CDs to burn the music onto.
\subsection{Research}\label{research}
Following on from the perspective of copyright I need to explore the different
sources of getting this copyright-free media. My client has mentioned serveral
times that youtube is the best place to get the music as it contains even
the most obscure songs. Obvisouly not all content on youtube is copyright-free
but after investigating the website I discovered a catergory called "creative
commons" on the search filter. This will then only show videos that have no
legal restrictions on it. After examining the url it became clear that this
would also be easy to implement into my application as I can search
videos with this characterstic on youtube by substituting my query into the
url.

I was however a little concerned with whether it was possible to download
videos from the youtube website. After searching around on the internet
I found various tools that perform this task such as "youtube-dl", there
are also a couple of websites that do the same thing like "https://www.genyoutube.net/"
. I did question the client regarding these tools and whether she would
be happy using something like this. The exact response is given in the interview
below but essential some of these applications have difficult to use interfaces
like CLI and lack the ability to orgranise and burn music onto CDs.

Originally thought it may be good to use youtube-dl to download the music
and then have my application to process and manage the music. However Due to it being written in python
and my application written in c++
it is difficult to interact between the two. One approach that I though about taking was to compile
python and youtube-dl into a windows executable to then download then download the music. There are a couple of problems with this, the
first is that it is very slow due to it being compile from a python language making it not very practical.
The second problem was that there is only a windows version of the executable meaning it would not
able to run on other systems. The second point goes against the clients wishes so
I dismissed the idea.
\subsection{Client Interview}\label{ClientInterview}
This section below is the dialog between me and the client. All of the clients requirements I got through this
interview.
\begin{itemize}
    \item "What problem would you like this project to solve?"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "I need a way to get songs like nursery rymes off the internet and put them on a CD"
    \end{itemize}
    \item "Do you have any suggestions to solving the problem?"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "Not really. Perhaps a program that can search the internet for songs and download them.
            Youtube has a lot of the songs I want perhaps you could use that"
    \end{itemize}
    \item "How do you currently do the task?"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "At the moment I sometimes try and get some of the music from the web but I often click the wrong
            link and click and advert instead, I try to use CDs and spotify when I can"
    \end{itemize}
    \item "How much data is recorded to perfrom this task?"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "Usually it just requires me to download a song"
    \end{itemize}
    \item "Is there any other information like artist or genere you would like me about each song?"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "I think having artist and genere and that kinda of thing would be useful but isn't a priority"
    \end{itemize}
    \item "What devices do you perform the task on and how slow are they?"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "Currently I use my work and personal laptop which are both old and quite slow.
            I also use a very old cuba player to play the music so it needs to work with that"
    \end{itemize}
    \item "What problems do you face with your current system?"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "As I mention before I often accidently click on the wrong thing when using the web, I am also very concern with
            the legality behind it. It becomes very expensive trying to use other means like spotify or buying CDs"
    \end{itemize}
    \item "Can you take me through the steps of the old system in how it worked?"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "I would usually search for a free version of the song online and find a download link. After downloading
            I would burn the music on a disk using windows. If I can't find a link I try to find it on spotify or
            buy the actual CD containg the song off amazon"
    \end{itemize}
    \item "Are there any parts of the system you would like to do manually?"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "I would ideally like the app to handle everything"
    \end{itemize}
    \item "How often do you think you will be using this program?"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "Probbaly about once every one or two months"
    \end{itemize}
    \item "What kind of output do you want the program to ouput?"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "A CD containg the songs in the order I want that can be played on the CD player I have"
    \end{itemize}
    \item "Are there any constraints this program has to work in?"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "I'm not allowed to install and change stuff on my work computer."
    \end{itemize}
    \item "Do you need this program to work on both you work and personal laptop?"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "Yes, if that's possible"
    \end{itemize}
    \item "Do you think you'll need to delete this songs at later dates?"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "I usually don't end up delete these songs as I might need them again and it's difficult to
            download them again"
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Objectives}\label{the-problem}
Given this information the problem that I need to solve with this
application is to be able to get music from online and burn it to a disk
for my client to use. With this I can start to outline some objectives I
want this program to meet.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Allow the user to download music

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Must allow the user to search youtube
        \item Must allow the user to then select from a range of results which are copyright free
        \item The user must then be allowed to preview a result
        \item the user must be able to pause, play and seek forward in preview
        \item Must allow the user to download video being previewed
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Allow the user to create and organise playlists

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Must allow the user to create a named playlist
        \item Must allow the user to add songs to whichever playlist
        \item Must allow the user to delete songs from whichever playlist
        \item Must allow the user to change the order of songs in playlist
        \item Must allow the user to perfrom these steps using a drag and drop mechanisim
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Allow the user to burn music to a CD

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Must allow the user to select a playlist
        \item Must allow the user to then initiate the burn process via a button
        \item Burnt CD must be compatible with old CD player
        \item Order of songs on the CD must be the same as the order of songs on the playlist
    \end{enumerate}

    \item The application must be compaitble with different platforms

\end{enumerate}

\section{Design}\label{design}
This section will begin to explain how I plan to create this application.
\subsection{Outline}\label{outline}
The Qt library which is the library that I am using uses widgets which are window
like objects that can be embedded into one another to create a GUI. The bullets
points below show how I plan to embed each of these widgets.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Main Window
        \begin{itemize}
            \item TabWidget
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Download Tab
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item search
                            \item preview
                        \end{itemize}
                    \item LibraryTab
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item playlist list
                            \item tableview
                        \end{itemize}
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The widget at the top of the hierarchy will be a child class of QMainWindow. This
allows me to use some of the functionality of QMainWindow like adding a menu bar
and shortcuts. I will then set the tabwidget as the central widget of this
allowing me to add tabs to my window. The next two bullet points Are the widgets
that the user will interact with to download and play music. The DownloadTab will
contain the an interface to preview the youtube video and then download it while
the LibraryTab will allow the user create playlists and organise the music. Figure 1
below illustrates this hierarchy graphically.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 2cm, auto]
        % Place nodes
        \node [block] (init) {Main Window};
        \node [block, below of=init] (TabWidget) {Tab Widget};
        \node [block, below left=of TabWidget] (DownloadTab) {DownloadTab};
        \node [block, below right=of TabWidget] (LibraryTab) {LibraryTab};
        \node [block, below left=of DownloadTab] (Preview) {Preview};
        \node [block, fill=none, draw=none, below right=of DownloadTab] (PlaceHolder) {};
        \node [block, left of=PlaceHolder] (Search) {Search};
        \node [block, right of=PlaceHolder] (PlaylistList) {Playlist list};
        \node [block, below right=of LibraryTab] (PlaylistView) {Playlist View};
        % Draw edges \path [line] (init) -- (identify);
        \path [line] (init) -- (TabWidget);
        \path [line] (TabWidget) -- (DownloadTab);
        \path [line] (TabWidget) -- (LibraryTab);
        \path [line] (DownloadTab) -- (Preview);
        \path [line] (DownloadTab) -- (Search);
        \path [line] (LibraryTab) -- (PlaylistList);
        \path [line] (LibraryTab) -- (PlaylistView);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Layer Model} \label{fig:Layer Model}
\end{figure}
The two item on the graph above which has the most visual significance would be
DownloadTab and LibraryTab as they are the direct descendants of the Tab Widget.
Due to this fact I think that it is important to layout how I intend this two item to
look. The first that we will look at will be the Download Tab which is shown as Figure
~\ref{fig:DownloadTab Diagram}. There are quite a few objects on this diagram which are
not in the layer model (Fig ~\ref{fig:Layer Model}) these objects are to interact with
the two main widgets on the DownloadTab which are preview and searchlist. As the name
suggests the preview is to allow the user to view the video before downloading while.
Within GUI and network programming you often want one object to be notified when an event
happens to another. Fortunately Qt recognises this problem and has signals and slots to
solve it. To use these you need to use the emit to create a signal and the you can use
a slot to listen out for that signal and run a procedure when that signal is received.
This is vital when interacting with the user as when the user clicks a button or interacts
with the interface a signal is emitted and I need to connect a slot up to these signals
to make the application work.
With this knowledge I can start to explain how all of the classes come together and
function with the figures shown below. All of these figures are annotated and should
explain them in detail. It is important to know that the diagrams only show the
public procedures and functions currently. This is because I want to clearly line
out how they interact with one another. The only figure without this annotation is
figure ~\ref{fig:Struct layout} so I will explain it here. All of the structs that I
am describing occur in the classes VideoYoutube (Fig ~\ref{fig:VideoYoutube class layout})
and HttpHandler (Fig ~\ref{fig:HttpHandler class layout}) and the first to dive into is
download. This struct is to store information about the current downloaded video. The
first property "reply" is to store the response from the http request which will
especially important for checking for errors and making sure it has the right thing. The
next property "tempfile" is important for insurance reasons as the download may be
interrupted causing the file to be corrupt. In order to prevent this I thought it would
be best to create a temporary file that will be automatically deleted by the operating
system after a period of time. This means I can continually put data into this temporary
file and when the download file is finished save it into a permanent file. To have the
correct name to save the file to I have the title property. The "progress",
"currentProgress" and "getProgress" are used to keep track of progress for the download
progress bar. The "segments" and "segmentPosition" is to allow the functionality to
download the video if it is cut into segments. "CurrentStatus" is to get the http status
code. Finally the "download()" procedure is to initiate the download process.
The "fmtQuality" and "videoQuality" structs store the qualities and there relevant
urls. The first property of the "fmtQuality" struct is "quality" which stores the quality
that is listed by youtube. The "resolution", "video" and "audio" properties are to store
their qualities respectively. The procedure "fmtQuality" is the constructor to initialise
all of these properties. The "videoQuality" has the same "quailty" property but also has
"audioUrl" and "videoUrl". These actually store the url to download the video. It should be
noted that I put this property in "videoQuality" instead of "download" because there
multiple urls for a video each different due to the quality. The "videoQuality" procedure
is different ways of initializing the properties and the operator is to compare the
different qualities.
Finally the "jsMethod" struct is to store the the JavaScript code from youtubes code in
order to parse signatures to make the urls valid.
I need to also consider the data structure I am going to use for controlling the order of
the songs that will be played through LibraryTab. There are two data structures which
I am currently considering: Linkedlist and an array.% A comparison table is shown in Fig \ref{fig:Data structure table}.
Based on the the ease of use I
belive that the easier and more efficient option would be to use an array.
%\break
Another key design feature I need to implement is making the use of the program as
intuitive as possible. Because of this I think the best way for the user to insert
songs and reorder them would be through a drag and drop system. This would require
me to set up various variables and features embedded in qt which is described
\href{http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/model-view-programming.html#using-drag-and-drop-with-item-views}
{here}.

\subsection{DatabaseHandling}\label{DatabaseHandling}
As mention previously I decided that I would use a database to keep track of the
downloaded music. To do this I will have one main table that will have any
downloaded song automatically inserted into it. This table will be called "AllSongs"
. This "AllSongs" table with contain 5 columns which I will describe here.
The first column is the "id" columns which will be use to order the data
and to refrence the data inside "AllSongs". Because of this id will be an
integear with each one being unique and auto increment. The second column
is "TrackName" which as the title suggest will be a text field containing
the name of the download song. The next two columns will be "artists" and
"genre" which will both be integers to reference values in the artist and
genre tables. This will avoid duplicates. These tables will have an id field
identical to the AllSongs table and the artist and genre columns will
reference values using this field. Finally there will be the duration
file which is a double that will hold the length of the song in minuets.
To further avoid duplications any playlist created by the user will reference
the songs in "AllSongs".In order to allow these references I will need to use join
statements in sql. I need to use this statement as I still want the artist and
genre columns in the users playlist without having to create this additional columns.
By using select with these join statement along with the where clause I should
be able to grab all data that has the same id. The diagram below (fig \ref{fig:databaseDiagram}) should show
the overall design of the database.

    \caption{Database Overview} \label{fig:databaseDiagram}
\end{figure}


A requirement by my client is the ability to reorder the songs. My approach
to this is to switch the id of the two songs to switch them in the view.
Due to both id's having the unique property I will need to use the id as
0 for a temp value. This should be relatively simple with sql update statements
Another database quirk that I need to take into consideration is when the user
deletes a song in the playlist as this will cause there to be gaps in the
ids of tables. This is problematic as I cannot get the right id by getting
the rowid. There are two ways I could solve this: I update all of the ids
greater that the deleted item so there are no gaps or allow gaps and find
a way of selecting a row of data in the database by how far down it is.
The first option is a bad idea as this means changing id which are going
to be used as relations and it may become time consuming for large
amount of rows. The second option is much better but I was original unsure
of how to achieve it untill I discovered the "OFFSET" clause. With this
I can offset a select statement n rows down the table making this task
trivial.
With this knowledge I have created a table below in figure ~\ref{fig:SQLTable}
that I belive I will need for the database.

\subsection{NetworkHandling}\label{NetworkHandling}
As remarked previously a key part to this project is the process
of extracting the video url from youtube so it can be previewed
and the sound be downloaded. This section describes this process.
The series of diagrams below illustrate how I plan to complete this
objective.

The are a few functions or procedures that I will clarify here. The overall
object of all of these subroutines is to assign the appropiate format to a
link and evaulate a signature for each video and audio url. The signature is required
as witout it being added to the url youtube will reject the request
as it will not be authorised. In order to extract the necessary javascript code
to generate the signature the "parseJS" subroutine is called which the goes on
to call the "extractJSMethod" subroutine. Since there are multiple formats of
audio and video availiable there are multiple urls and these two subroutines extract each
javascript method for each url and adds them to the "jsMethods" property. When this
is originally called the urls for each quality and format have not been found. It is only later
when "getFmtLink" and "getUrlFromFmtLink" is called the javascript method is
execute in the "parseSignature" function, returning the signature which is then
added to the url.

\subsection{Burning the audio CD}
Due to one of my original requirements I need to ensure that this program is cross-platform
which raises a problem when it comes to the cd burning process as different platforms have
different methods to burning an audio data to a cd. To resolve this problem I decide that
I would run 3rd party software that would be able to run on all platforms from my own
program. There are a few out there but the one that seemed best supported and had good
documentation was the cdrtools collection. The program in this collection that is relevent
to this project is "cdrecord". This program allows data to be burnt to a cd of your choosing.
unfortunately running this within the program normally will cause it to freeze until it finishes.
Because of this I think it will be best to use another thread to run this process in. Luckily
Qt has a class call QThread which allow threading in qt.
I was also unsure whether the program could be called multiple times with a different track
and CD as this would be the best approach to burning music to the cds for two reasons. The
first is that if there is an error burning one track the others should still be able be burnt
onto the cd. The second is that I can update the progress bar with each succesful burning operation.
I thought the best way for me to figure this out was to test the executable with various options.
After testing the cdrecord program, I found that the following arguments are required to perform the
desired behaviour: -dev, -pad, -multi and -tao. The dev option is use to set the id of the
cd drive you wish to use. You can find out this device id by running the program with the -scanbus
option. unfortunately on Linux this does required root permission, when I tried using it with a
usb cd, which generally is a bad idea and could cause problems in other areas of my program. The
only solution to this permission issue is to edit the sudoers file to make an exception for this
command. The next option, -pad, is used to make the audio data from the downloaded file a multiple
of 2352 bytes. This is a required standard for audio CDs. the "-multi" option does exactly what
I want to do in regards to burning each track in separate commands. Finally the "-tao" option is
actually something that is enabled by default by cdrecord but by explicitly specifying the option
it will speed up the execution process by not doing a count down.
\subsection{Data flow and data types}
In this section I will define all of the data requirements for this project which will include
the information imputed by the user and the final output. The database and the converted audio
files are all stored in the downloads folder. This is a directory created by the DataHandler
class where it create a new folder from the builds current path called downloads. Before being
converted the audio data is saved in the temporary folder of the current OS it is running on.
For example on Linux this is "/tmp". The reasoning behind this is that the download may get
interrupted and become corrupted making it difficult to deal with. If it save in the temporary
folder the OS deals with it automatically and will clean up any mess left.

\subsubsection{Data Structures used}
There are many data structures that are introduced by the qt framework. You can usually distinguish
these data structures from the normal c++ data structures by the fact they have a "Q" affixed to
the start of their name. These data structures are described in figure ~\ref{fig:qtDataStructs}.

\section{Testing}
In this section I will test my built application against the objectives that I originally stated and make sure
that my applications fulfills the purpose it is meant to. The table in figure \ref{fig:testTable1} shows the list
of tests that I performed and whether the program pass the test or not. The table references numerous pictures
in \ref{fig:tSample} to show proof of the test. Finally below that I create a references section that gives
additional information about each of the fail tests. Since one of my main objectives was to make sure the app
was cross-platform I have tested these scnarios on both windows and linux.

    This test fails due to accessing an index in a list that was not available. This fail when trying to
    go to the next song when before selecting a playlist so it is likely caused by not having either index
    or tracklist properties set in PlayerWindow.cpp

\section{Evaluation}
I belive that the final program achieves the main objectives but work could be done to improve the stability
and reliability of the program. The final product also differs from my original design in many ways, particularly
with the burning process where I used a QProcess instead of a QThread. Another major change is the way that I
store the filename of the downloaded audio. I found that using the original file caused issues when I either
tried to convert it or burn it to a CD due to special characters acting in unpredictable ways. To get around this
issue I hashed the filename and store it in the database with the filename. This was so I could still present
a readable name to the user while still being able to find which hash belonged to which file.

I do belive that the system is effective as it can find copy right free content and download it at a decent
speed while avoiding things like ads and malware which the user would experience if she wanted to download
music off the web. Due to the drag and drop iteraction the system is easy to learn. How long this solution
will last for however might be a problem as youtube is likely to change and update in the future which
might make the current method of getting the music broken.

I am quite please with the sucess of completing objectives 1(a) to 1(e). I do however belive that the
the process could be made more stable and reliable given more time to work on it. The search bar
in the download tab allows the user to enter the search term to search for youtube videos acheiving
objective 1(a). The application then substitutes this into a url and then performs a get request
on this url which returns a list of copyright-free videos, completing objective 1(b). The user then
can select any one of these return videos from the list to preview the video and audio, acheiving 1(c).
The user can then play, pause and seek forward in this preview by the controls under the preview window,
completing the objective 1(d). Finally the user can then click the download button under the controls to
download the audio of the video which fullfills the last objective 1(e).

The next set of objectives was to allow the user to create and organise playlists. Although I did meet these
objectives the solution is not as complete as it was for the previous set. This was mostly because time was
starting to become an issue and to fullfill some the objectives required unconventional use of databases
like swaping rows and deleting rows based on how many rows down they were rather than a  single property.
Allowing the user to create a named playlist was the first and easiest objective to complete as I only had
to create a button that would create a table and a playlist object. The next objective 1(b) was more complex
as to ensure that the object 1(e) was fullfill I needed to implement a drag and drop to add songs to a
playlist. Once this system was complete it added a basis to complete objective 1(d). All I needed to do
to complete object 1(d) was to then add a series of select and delete queries based on the row that the
user select. Unfortunatly this raised a problem as there was not in built way in Qt to find the row
that the user dropped on. To solve this I created an alogrythm to find the how that the user mouse is
currently hovering over and triggered this algorythm every time the user performed the drop action.
Finally the delete option for objective 1(c) needed to be built. I managed to complete this by using a
single SQL statement to find a row based on how may rows down it was and then deleting that row. The
problem however is that the song is never delete from the computer's storage only the database.
So although this does meet the clients needs and the objectives I set out to complete it is not
an efficient solution in terms of storage.

The next two main objectives, three and four, are interlinked as many of the problems I encountered
while trying to complete objective three was caused by objective four. This because I was using an
external program called "cdrecord" to perform the actual burning. This meant that the app had to
choose the correct version of the program as linux would not be able to run a .exe executable and
vice versa with windows. Addtional permissions caused issues as unix based systems like linux require
admin privilidges to read and write to a disk drive. This was very problomatic as for burning process
to work on linux the applicaiton had to be launch as a root user which is generally bad practice and
caused other areas of the application to fail. There is little I can do about this as this is the way
the linux kernel is built. There is a work around however by editing the sudoers file you can make
an exception for the application making it work perfectly. I do not think this is a issue for the
client. The reasoning behind this is that the only computer where the cilent does not have the
permssions to run the app as root is on here work laptop. Fortuatly this work laptop does and will
for the foreseeable future run windows where the permission problems do not occur. The only instance
where she may not be running windows will be on her personal laptop where she will have the appropiate
permssions.

With the exception of the problems mention in the previous paragragh the objectives in question three
were reasonably easy to meet. The first 3(a) was solved by adding an addionaly mouse event to the
drag and drop system allowing the user to select and highlight the intended playlist. Adding
a button to initate the burn process was fairly straighforward and acheived with Qt, completing
objective 3(b). Fortunatly objective 3(c) raised no problems as the default behaviour of "cdrecord"
allowed the music burnt onto the cd to be played with the cd player. The last objective, 3(d), was
easily completed by feeding songs into "cdrecord" individually with the "-multi" argument as planned
in the design stage of this project.


\subsection{User feedback}
This section shows some quotes from the user and my thoughts on how I can act upon this feedback.

\begin{itemize}
    \item "I like the search feature but the result returned seems limited"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I'm glad the user likes the search feature and can understand the issue
            she has with the limited results. This is caused by app only getting the results
            from the first page of results from the search on youtube. A possible solution
            to this would be to get the next page of results from youtube when the scroll bar
            reaches the bottom of the list. Additionaly if the user can find the video
            on youtube but not with the application perhaps it would make more sense to
            add a text bar where the user can paste the youtube url into it.
    \end{itemize}
    \item While the user used the application I observed that she sometimes got confused with the
        table she was currently looking at. Perhaps it would be better to make it clearer
        about what table was being used by have the table name in bold above the table
        view along with some colouring.
    \item "While I am previewing a video it sometimes buffers"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The user said this as a passing comment but I think it may be possible to act upon
            by changing the default quality of the preview to the lowest possible one. This
            makes a lot of sense as the video quality is largely unimportant but the sound
            quality is. Additional the preview is to simply check that the video select
            is the one you want.
    \end{itemize}
    \item "I like that you can group the songs so I can choose what I burn"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This was some positive feedback that the client gave about the ability to
            organise the songs into different playlists.
    \end{itemize}
    \item "It's easy, the interface is very user-friendly"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is another piece of positive feedback from the client. I'm glad that
            she finds it easy to navagate as it gives her the independence to do it on her
            own which was one of the key things that she wanted from the project.
    \end{itemize}
    \item "Would be useful to know how many songs I can fit on a CD"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is some constructive critisim that the client gave about the application.
            Since there is limited space on a CD she did not know how many songs could be burnt
            to a CD and therefore how many are allowed on a single playlist. This makes a lot of
            sense and I think it would be useful to add a memory couter which would determine
            the size of all the songs in the playlist and warn the user if it goes over 700Mb
            which is the storage size of a CD.
    \end{itemize}
    \item "a share option to put the music on other computers would be useful"
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is another piece of constructive critisim. The user would want a function
            that would allow songs to be shared to another computer. I think this could be a
            useful feature to have an export button which would save the songs to a external
            folder.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Overall the client seemed pleased with the result and I think with some minor tweeks it could
be a valuable tool.
